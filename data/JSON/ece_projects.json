    "project_description": "The supply chain for food and dietary supplements has become more complex, distributed, and also less secure over time. As a result, different types of fraudulent activities \u2013 e.g. adding harmful substances, re-branding of inferior products, etc., leading to integrity issues in these products have emerged as a serious concern. Every year, consumers are cheated of billions of dollars, and the monetary value of fraud in food and dietary or nutritional supplements is estimated to be over $40 billion annually. Existing solutions for analysis often require extensive sample preparation or are limited in terms of detecting different types of integrity issues. We are working on a novel authentication method based on Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance (NQR) spectroscopy, which is quantitative, non-invasive, and non-destructive. It is sensitive to small deviation in the solid-state chemical structure of a product, which changes the NQR signal properties. These characteristics are unique for different manufacturers, resulting in manufacturer-specific watermarks. We use a machine learning-based classification called support vector machines (SVMs) to verify the authenticity of products under test. This approach has been evaluated using semi-custom hardware. We are also working on making a portable setup of the entire setup.",

    "project_description": "Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) are increasingly utilized in diverse applications, such as military, health-care, automotive systems, and the Internet of Things (IoT). The security of FPGA-based designs has emerged as a critical concern due to the FPGA design files (bitstreams) being vulnerable to attacks. Bitstream obfuscation has been recently studied as a potential solution that provides the necessary protection to designs mapped onto FPGA. This approach relies on a key generation function, such as Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) to alter a mapped function both structurally and functionally. However, a fundamental problem with PUF-based key generators is that the key bits are unstable and therefore cannot provide the same desired key at all times. In this project, we will implement a robust obfuscation approach that is capable of tolerating bit-flips in the generated key. We will develop an algorithm that applies the obfuscation to designs mapped to any FPGA. Finally, we will demonstrate the robustness against bit-flips on several digital signal processing (DSP) intellectual property (IP) blocks and observed the performance under various percentages of bit-flips in the key.",

    "project_description": "Internet of Things (IoT) has become a novel and popular paradigm in the scenario of communication, sensing, security, etc. and they have greatly impacted our lives in multiple application domains, including transportation and logistics, health care, personal, social, smart environment, and so on. The heterogeneous array of such devices in an infrastructure can greatly benefit from a hardware difficult-to-clone and a set of tamper-immune identifiers, which can be used to check the authenticity or integrity of a device. However, IoT entities are extremely vulnerable to attacks including physical tampering attacks since they are exposed and unattended in the environment for a long period of time. So, we are focusing on developing an intrinsic device identifier that captures the state of an IoT device and it can effectively reflect any physical tampering by transforming the intrinsic delay/transient current variations of boundary scan cell (BSC) paths into unique and robust signatures. This approach utilizes the boundary scan chain architecture (BSA) in integrated circuits (ICs) and printed circuit boards (PCB) \u2013 a prevalent design-for-test (DFT) structure used in majority of PCBs today. Based on a standard DFT structure, this method works for heterogeneous devices and can be conducted during runtime of the device. We will generate signatures from devices under test and evaluate their security parameters in terms of uniqueness, robustness, randomness, etc. We will also explore a protocol for the cloud server, owner, or other IoT devices in a network to verify the identity of an IoT device using the proposed approach. This policy should be able prevent attacks to extract the secret keys of a device using an efficient moving target defense mechanism that periodically shifts the challenge vectors.",

For such instances, RE represents an important tool for validating the performance, quality, authenticity, and integrity of electronics. Similarly, many of the critical systems and infrastructures in use today are decades old. Maintaining them requires electronic components that are no longer available. Replacing or redesigning the entire system may be too time consuming or expensive. However, through RE one can study the particular component/board in order to reproduce it and/or replace it with an alternative in the legacy system. On the other hand, RE can be responsible for just as many threats as solutions. RE can also be exploited to generate unauthorized clones or find weaknesses in the system. As part of this project, students will analyze 3D images of PCBs and develop a tool that processes the image (assigns different pixel values to traces, vias, etc.), stiches together results, extracts the PCB netlist, and converts the resulting images/netlist into a CAD file. Students should be able to program/script in Matlab or similar language. Familiarity with PCB design tools and pattern recognition would be useful but is not required.",

The sensing module is integrated with a microprocessor, a Bluetooth wireless module, and a battery. A prototype module has been demonstrated while sensor refinements for a strain gauge sensor for biting force detection and an infrared (IR) sensor for vital sign monitoring are under investigation. A strain gauge sensor can be used. Biting during Bruxism produces a pressure of about 100lbs to 200lbs i.e, 2000kPa. Hence, the sensor should be able to withstand this pressure level with a reasonable resolution. For IR sensing, a commercial product is accommodated. Efforts for signal processing will be needed.",

    "project_description": "Since the inception of mass-produced electronic devices in the 1970s, IC packaging has been a vital piece of the electronics supply chain. Packaging reliability has been discussed widely in both industry and academia. However, packaging security assessment is barely addressed in such communities. Malicious changes in packaging parameters by a manufacturer can result in undetected features that cause chip failure. This results in disastrous consequences when these changed chips go to critical applications such as space, military, hospitals, powerplants, etc. In this project, the first step is to understand the structure and material composition of different kinds of IC packaging. To achieve such understanding, the project involves evaluating the packaging with the physical inspection methods in our lab to see how the security vulnerabilities of IC packaging can be generated and exploited. Based on security issues, different kinds of protection methods will be developed later. One such attack vector is a backside attack, which is both cheap and simple. With a device as simple as a laser pointer, attackers can hack into the chips. By applying a certain wavelength laser on the chip backside, hackers can easily extract useful information or inject fault. This project aims to prevent this kind of attack happens. In the project, learning and understanding of backside attack will be the first step, and students will get a chance to do backside attacks by themselves in the lab. Based on their own background and knowledge, they can develop their own backside protection methods.",

    "project_description": "X-Ray Computed Tomography (X-Ray CT) is a rapidly advancing field due to the advent of next-generation tools such as Micro-CT & Nano-CT. In addition to hardware advances, there are software improvements that offer increased speed and resolution for fast failure analysis. Auto-3D is the refining and incorporation of these advanced techniques into the hardware assurance and reverse engineering processes and flows used in the cybersecurity industry. The current methods of hardware verification for microelectronics involves destructive techniques such as cross sectioning and delayering to analyze with visual methods. Non-destructive volumetric methods such as X-ray analysis has been adequate for simple electronics designs. However, smaller internal circuitry and its increasing complexity creates many x-ray imaging issues for non-destructive internal analysis. These imaging issues include artifacts such as photon starvation due to the entire absorption of x-rays by dense materials such as metals from circuitry, components, or heat/EMF shields. The Auto-3D project is focused on improving computational runtime speed and resolution of the reconstruction of 2D images into 3D volumes, optimizing the scan parameters of x-ray imaging for electronics through laboratory testing and computer simulation, and automated segmentation of 3D volumes and performing analysis of noise and errors via machine learning. As part of this project: students will work together to research and develop solutions, facilitate learning outcomes aligned with future academic research or industry requirements, build data-driven designs and proposals that improve upon known research in the field, and interact with F.I.C.S. faculty and facilities through presentations and lab experiments.",

    "project_description": "The goal of AutoBoM is to automatically extract a Bill of Materials (BoM), the list of all components on a printed circuit board (PCB) given an image of the board. The extracted BoM can then be used for reverse engineering and hardware assurance purposes. For instance, such a BoM can be compared to the known list of materials for the same sample, showing any discrepancy resulting from malicious tampering. When no reference BoM is present, verification becomes much more difficult. In these cases, AutoBoM can generate a tentative circuit schematic and cross-reference it against common design metrics. In these cases, Trojans or other manipulations will appear as violations to these standards. AutoBoM involves two primary research domains: the initial stages of image acquisition and preprocessing, followed by the use of machine learning models for component detection, classification, and identification. Image acquisition and processing inputs to the AutoBoM process include several 2D optical images of PCB surfaces. Various image processing and computer vision algorithms then extract information from these images necessary to train machine learning networks. Several subdomains are important in this stage to analyze the image data. Image segmentation, or breaking an image into distinct regions, assists in gathering ground truth data which trains machine learning models in how to detect components on a PCB image. Next, standard preprocessing procedures such as morphological processing, bandpass filtering, structural analysis, and more determine which portions of the image may require in-depth evaluation. This feedback serves two important functions. First, it determines which neural network architectures are appropriate for different stages of the AutoBoM process (e.g. component detection, defect analysis, etc.). Second, it assists in formatting the data as inputs to these networks, which speeds up learning and processing times. Machine learning models for detection, classification, identification Inputs to the machine learning side of the AutoBoM process include the important computer vision features extracted from the PCB images (e.g. colors, shapes, and textures). Then, a multi-stage machine learning methodology is applied. First, the machine learning algorithms detect the location of the components within the PCB images. Then, the algorithm determines the type of each component (e.g. resistor, capacitor, IC). Finally, AutoBoM leverages information such as on-component text, board text, and colors to uniquely identify each component. The end result is a BoM specific enough to purchase all required components necessary to reverse engineer the PCB.",
