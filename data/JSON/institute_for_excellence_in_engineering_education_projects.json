This ability encompasses what an engineering student needs to learn to be able to create engineering solutions that satisfy the needs and expectations of different stakeholders (e.g. customers, regulation entities, boards of directors, etc). Research questions: What is this ability? How is it learned or developed? How can it be assessed? How can it be effectively taught? Research methods: Qualitative to understand its learning and generate the assessment tools (phenomenography and content analysis). Quantitative to assess the effectiveness of its teaching, and standardize its assessment.",

    "project_description": "Our group is looking for an undergraduate student to develop a rigorous systematic literature review summarizing the best practices for engineering communities enacting transformational change for social justice. Transformational change refers to a frame-breaking change that completely alters the current operating structure, such as processes, people, and technology. A systematic review is defined as a review of the evidence on a clearly formulated question that uses systematic and explicit methods to identify, select, and critically appraise relevant primary research and extract and analyze data from the studies included in the review. Social implications in the engineering practice may involve concepts of peace/non-peace, gender equality, care for the environment, poverty, and public safety, and social justice. The research will include an in-depth literature review using commonly known databases (e.g., Web of Science, Academic Search Premier, Scopus), the use of analysis software (e.g., Endnote, MAXQDA, Covidence), and dissemination (i.e., journal publication and presentation). This opportunity will require the student to manage an undergraduate research project by dedicating around 10-15 hours per week. The participant will also gain valuable experience that will make them a more qualified candidate upon graduation. The student will end this experience with a written research portfolio including but not limited to a research proposal, report, literature review, and blog pieces.",
