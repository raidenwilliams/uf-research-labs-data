Many of our projects emphasize children and/or families as a unique user group. Our projects advance human-computer interaction (HCI) research questions of how users want to interact with these natural modalities, and computer science research questions of how to build recognition algorithms that can understand user input in these ambiguous modalities. Top priorities currently: (a) designing intelligent chatbots for mobile health monitoring apps; (b) designing digital AI assistants to help novice users complete more expert tasks; and (c) designing human-centered interactive machine learning interfaces.",

One way to obtain HRTFs is to measure responses of spatial sound sources to probe microphones located at blocked ear entrances in an anechoic chamber. Research has shown that personalized HRTFs have many advantages over generic or non-individualized HRTFs and provide a more realistic hearing experience. Measurement is not a practical method to individualize HRTFs. We provide a numerical simulation method of individual HRTFs acquisition from 3-D scanned mesh. The project aims to collect a personalized HRTFs database to study the statistical relationship between spectral features and anthropometric features. Our research also conducts auditory perception tests for each simulated HRTF to compare the perception difference between simulated HRTFs and generic HRTFs. We also try to reduce the cone of confusion, a common phenomenon in virtual sound source localization. The simulation and mesh scan prototype pipeline already exists. Students are welcome to help research teams in the following tasks: \u25cf Participants\u2019 3-D head meshes acquisition and post-processing. \u25cf Integrating mesh postprocessing procedures. \u25cf Help team members perform perception tests and analyze data.",

    "project_description": "3D audio, commonly referred to as spatial audio, allows users to gather various forms of information quickly. Therefore, this work aims to assist firefighters in first responder situations in improving response times and their path traversed to locations of interest, based on how the 3D audio sound is presented. To achieve this feat, it is crucial to understand what sonic cues, if any, will need to be exaggerated or minimized to receive the best outcome possible within low visibility scenarios faced by firefighters to improve their localization of various points of interest. The selected student will work closely with a graduate student to: \u2022 Conduct hands-on human-centered studies \u2022 Analyze the data collected in MATLAB \u2022 Create digestible visualizations of the data in MATLAB",

    "project_description": "Everyday tasks such as getting a cup from the cupboard, driving to work, or clicking icons on a computer screen, make use of the human capacity to store and recall location information. More critical tasks, such as remembering the location of anatomical structures during a surgical operation or a fire escape during a fire, make use of the same ability. The part of human memory that allows us to remember where things are in our environment is commonly referred to as spatial memory. The importance of spatial memory to human action and interactions is an area of interest in various research fields, including psychology, medicine, and human-computer interaction. One of the most used tests for measuring spatial memory is the Corsi Block-Tapping Test (CBT). While physical CBTs have been used extensively to study human spatial memory in the physical world, few CBTs have been created to examine spatial memory in virtual worlds, such as those made with virtual and augmented reality headsets. The design of a digital CBT for virtual environments could lead to a better understanding of spatial memory in such environments. It could also allow for the creation of intuitive user interfaces and a deeper understanding of human spatial memory. Research Tasks:The research team developed several augmented reality CBTs using the Microsoft Hololens. The selected student will assist in conducting subject studies relating to these CBTs. Tasks will include: \u2022 Developing an understanding of how the Microsoft Hololens works (e.g., QR code registration, spatial anchors, and mappings) \u2022 Developing an understanding of how various CBTs implemented in Augmented Reality (AR) measure aspects of spatial memory (e.g., walking versus reaching space) \u2022 Collecting data on subject performance in AR CBTs \u2022 Post-processing and analysis of subject\u2019s CBT data. The selected student may also assist in adding functionality (via the Unity game engine) to a final release of the CBT framework and porting the project to various VR devices such as the HTC Vive. While not required, familiarity with C#, Matlab, Python, and Unity will be helpful in completing the project.",
